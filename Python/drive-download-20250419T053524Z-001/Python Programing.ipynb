It can also read and modify files.\n","*   Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.\n","*   Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.\n","\n","\n","**Why Python?**\n","\n","*   Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).\n","*   Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.\n","*   Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.\n","*   Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.\n","*   Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.\n","\n","\n","**Python Syntax compared to other programming languages**\n","\n","Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English\n","\n","*   language with influence from mathematics.\n","*   Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other\n","*   programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.\n","*   Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes.\n","*   Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this
